Known Issues

- Wait for the Netflix home page to finish loading completely before starting a show/movie.
- Refresh the page if the secondary sub list is empty.
- This extension could conflict with other Netflix-related extensions (but not [NflxIntroSkip](https://github.com/gmertes/NflxIntroSkip)! :D). If you encounter any problem, try to disable some of them

Problems?

### Large gap between main subtitle and secondary subtitle
- This happens only when the controls bar is active -- just wait until the controls hide

### Only available in Chrome/Firefox for desktop?
- Yup -- mobile devices, smart TVs, Apple TV, Chromecast, … are not supported

### Could I load subtitles from other country?
- This extension respects Netflix rules, hence we only support all official subtitles available in your country

### Feature request: __________ ?
- This extension does one thing and does it well -- great experience with bilingual subtitles support
- If you have a request you can open an issue for consideration (please put [Feature Request] in the title)
